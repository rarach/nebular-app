GoDaddy seems to renew SSL certificate for nebular.app without private key (or I may have just forgotten it? :-/ ).
If we decide to keep using GoDaddy for issuing the cert, these are the steps taken last time to make it work:

1. Go to csrgenerator.com and generate new CSR:
Country: US
State: Georgia
Locality: Atlanta
Organization: Nebular
Org Unit: Dev Center
Common Name: nebular.app
Key Size: 2048
2. Take the generated text and split it in two parts: cert request itself and private key
3. Go to the certificate on GoDaddy and request new key ("re-key"). Paste the cert request part of CSR, submit
and wait for new certificate to be issued.
4. Download new cert, version for IIS (should contain one .crt file and few others).
5. In command line, execute (assuming OpenSSL tool is installed):
openssl pkcs12 -inkey private.key -in fromGoDaddy.crt -export -out nebular_app.pfx
This uses the private key part from step 2 saved in plain text file private.key. You're asked for a password
that will later be used in Azure portal.
6. In Azure Portal -> App Services -> <my_app_name> -> TLS/SSL settigs, delete current bindings for nebular.app.
7. In tab "Private Key Certificates (.pfx)" delete old version and upload new version of your nebular_app.pfx.
8. Go back to tab "Bindings" and delete old bindings (with www. and without). Re-create the bindings with new
certificate version and TLS/SSL Type "SNI SSL".
9. Wait couple minutes and verify it works on www.nebular.app
